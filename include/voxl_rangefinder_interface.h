 * @brief      Use this to simultaneously validate that the bytes from a pipe
 *             contains valid data, find the number of valid packets
 *             contained in a single read from the pipe, and cast the raw data
 *             buffer as a rangefinder_data_t* for easy access.
 *
 *             This does NOT copy any data and the user does not need to
 *             allocate a rangefinder_data_t array separate from the pipe read buffer.
 *             The data can be read straight out of the pipe read buffer, much
 *             like reading data directly out of a mavlink_message_t message.
 *
 *             However, this does mean the user should finish processing this
 *             data before returning the pipe data callback which triggers a new
 *             read() of the data pipe.
 *
 * @param[in]  data       pointer to pipe read data buffer
 * @param[in]  bytes      number of bytes read into that buffer
 * @param[out] n_packets  number of valid packets received
 *
 * @return     Returns the same data pointer provided by the first argument, but
 *             cast to an rangefinder_data_t* struct for convenience. If there was an
 *             error then NULL is returned and n_packets is set to 0
